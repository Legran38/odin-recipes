    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken is great, so is pizza. So why not combine both? This recipe is easy, quick to make and will brighten your day!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>4 slices pepperoni, or to taste - divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt and black pepper in a shallow bowl; place flour into a second bowl.
            Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a third bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture and dredge in flour; dip again in egg mixture and dredge chicken in crumb mixture
            until coated. Place coated chicken breasts into a baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is heated through and crumbs are golden (about 20 minutes)</li>
        <li>Sponn 2 tablespoons pizza sauce onto each chicken breast, sprinkle each with half the mozarella cheese and top each with half the pepperoni slices.</li>
        <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear (about 10 more minutes).
             An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
