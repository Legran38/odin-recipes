# odin-recipes

This Website is my first Project in The Odin Project.
It should reflect everything I have learned about HTML at this point of time.
This includes creating the basic HTML boilerplate, adding headers and paragraphs,
images and links. 
Also learing the workflow with Git and GitHub will be practiced.
